//you input a year and will tell you if the year is biciesto or not

//The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
//If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
//Unless... the year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

//According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
//while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.
